# Strong Password Generator

## Description

This project was part of my bootcamp challenges. The goal was to make a password generator that met specific criteria for a client. On pressing a button the user would be guided through a set of prompts to determine their password parameters. Upon completion they would be presented with the requested password. 

I was excited to tackle this challenge and I tried to do so in an efficient manner. It gave me a chance to learn more about Javascript and to test my ability to go from a simple idea to something responsive and functional. I felt this was a challenging project and actually enjoyed working on it.

## Usage

To use the generator, click the red generate password button.  

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-1.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
  
On the following prompt enter a value between 8 and 128.   

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-2.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
  
Then choose from 4 criteria:  
Uppercase letters,  

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-3.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
  
Lowercase letters,  

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-4.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
   
Numbers,   

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-5.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
   
and Special characters.  

<img alt="Generate Password" src="./assets/images/screenshot-6.png" width="300" style="display: block;"/>  
   
Once this is done the generator will display the created password.
